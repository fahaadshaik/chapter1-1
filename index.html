<h1 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center;">THE REDSTONE chapter 1 </h1>
<h2 style="font-size:30px; text-align:center;">Awakening of Destiny</h2>
<h3>When Fate and Magic Collide</h3>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height: 30px; margin-bottom:50px;">On that chilly February night, our group of friends had planned an adventurous hill climb. The date was set for the 24th, and anticipation buzzed through our college corridors. Our class teacher had even paid us a visit, reminding us about the upcoming science exhibition on the 26th. But we were young and restless, eager to escape the mundane routine.

At precisely 3 a.m., we piled into a car, headlights slicing through the darkness as we ascended the winding road toward the hills. The air smelled of pine and adventure. Little did we know that fate had other plans—a cosmic twist that would alter our lives forever.

As we rounded a bend, a celestial object plummeted from the sky, crashing right in front of our car. The screeching brakes echoed our shock. I leaped out, adrenaline coursing through my veins. There, lying in the dew-kissed grass, was a red stone its hue vibrant against the moonlit night. It seemed to pulse with energy, beckoning me.

Without hesitation, I picked it up. The moment my fingers touched its surface, a surge of warmth shot through me. The stone melded into my skin, sinking deep within. I collapsed, the world spinning around me.

My friends rushed me to the hospital, panic etched on their faces. The doctors examined me, puzzled by the inexplicable event. “Everything seems fine,” they said, but their eyes betrayed uncertainty.

Back home, I lay in bed, the red stone still nestled within me. That’s when I heard it a voice, faint yet urgent. It whispered my name, pleading for help. I followed the sound, stumbling through the darkness until I reached the window.

And there, hovering above the trees, was a strange man. His scars told tales of battles fought beyond our realm. He held my friends captive, demanding answers about me. The stone, it seemed, was more than a mere artifact it was a conduit, a bridge between worlds.

Desperation fueled my actions. Armed with a makeshift stick, I confronted the man. But he was no ordinary adversary. As he turned toward me, a blinding light erupted from my chest—the very spot where the stone resided. I collapsed, consciousness slipping away. When I awoke, I was no longer bound by gravity. I hovered, my body pulsing with newfound energy. The villain sneered, revealing his true purpose—to harness the stone’s power for himself. But I couldn’t let that happen.

With a surge of will, I flew at him. Our battle tore through the night, energy crackling around us. The stone within me responded, granting me abilities beyond imagination. And then, in a final clash, I defeated him. His form dissipated, leaving only echoes of malevolence.

I descended to where my friends stood, their eyes wide with awe. “What was that?” they stammered. I brushed off their questions, urging them to keep our secret. The red stone had awakened something ancient within me—a force that defied reason.

As dawn painted the sky, I gazed at the horizon. The hills whispered secrets, and the stone pulsed against my skin. My life had veered off course, hurtling toward the unknown. But one thing was clear: I was no longer ordinary. The red stone had chosen me, and my destiny awaited—a tapestry woven with magic, danger, and the promise of adventure. And so began my journey—
a chapter written in crimson, fueled by the enigma of the Red Stone. -In a dream, our protagonist lay injured and helpless in a dark place. Suddenly, a tree sprouted before them, and an old man appeared, radiating a golden light. He urgently declared, “Wake up! You must help others, Red Stone Master.” The dream faded, and our protagonist awoke, now named Ruary.

Living alone, Ruary walked to college one day when his redstone began to glow. He concealed it from others and fled to a nearby forest. His body moved involuntarily, drawn by an unseen force. Eventually, he arrived in the heart of the jungle, where an otherworldly spaceship materialized. Six soldiers emerged, assuming defensive positions. Following them, an elderly man and a middle-aged man stepped out, addressing Ruary as the Red Stone Master.

Suspicious, Ruary confronted the old man, demanding answers. Was this group here to harm him or steal the stone? The middle-aged man, with a purple stone embedded in his chest, assured Ruary they meant no harm. Instead, they sought to take him with them. The old man explained that the redstone had chosen Ruary as its owner based on potential, not physical strength.

Confused, Ruary boarded the spaceship, questioning their destination. The reply stunned him: they were bound for the planet of the stones, an outer space journey. The old man revealed a holographic display ranking the stones. The redstone, which Ruary possessed, stood as the most powerful. The green stone followed, challenging the redstone, but its owner was missing. The purple stone belonged to the man with the purple stone in his chest. The white and black stones held equal power, with the white stone already claimed by the group’s leader—a ruthless individual seeking all the stones.

Ruary realized the gravity of his role as the Red Stone Master. The old man promised training, but first, he needed to master the stone’s abilities. Arriving at the stone village, chaos reigned. A prisoner had escaped, wreaking havoc. The purple stone master prepared to fight, but the old man intervened, urging Ruary to demonstrate his redstone’s power. With a single blow, Ruary defeated the monster, astonishing everyone.

The old man declared Ruary their protector, alongside Dominic, the purple stone master. And so, Ruary’s intense training began to become THE RED STONE MASTER.
